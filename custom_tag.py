# The app should contain a templatetags directory, at the same level as models.py, views.py, etc. 
# If this doesn’t already exist, create it
# don’t forget the __init__.py file to ensure the directory is treated as a Python package.
  


  
# in directory "templatetags", create xxx.py

# in html 
{% load xxx %}
